# Machine_Learning_Phone_plans
This is my first machine learning project. In this project, i used machine learning and data analysis to create a model to predict the recommended phone plans for subcribers using data of current subscribers and their phone usage. 

Python Libraries that must be imported to get Notebook to function properly:

import pandas as pd
from sklearn.model_selection import train_test_split
from sklearn.ensemble import RandomForestClassifier
from sklearn.tree import DecisionTreeClassifier
from sklearn.metrics import accuracy_score
